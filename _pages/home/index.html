<p>I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Texas at Austin</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of <b>robotics</b>, <b>reinforcement learning</b>, and <b>representation learning</b>. I aim to improve a robot’s ability to act, perceive, and learn in complex environments, and ensure that a machine’s goals will always align with human goals.</p>

<p>Previously, I received my S.B. and M.Eng. degrees from the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, primarily studying Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence.</p>
