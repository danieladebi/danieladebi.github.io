        <h5>Background</h5>
        <p>I was born in New Jersey and raised in Delaware for most of my life. Even though I was born in America, I come from a Nigerian background, with my dad's side of the family being part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people">Igbo</a> tribe, and my mom's side of the family being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people">Yoruba</a>. </p>
        <h5>Motivation for Research</h5>
        <p>
        Throughout my childhood, I always had an interest for AI in robots, participating in robotics clubs in middle and high school as a programmer. However,
        before I went to college, I actually planned on pursuing a career in video game development, wanting to develop challenging agents for the player to compete against. It wasn't until I came to MIT that I realized how much I enjoyed studying AI, especially in the robotics setting.</p> 
        <p>
        In 2021, I took part in my first robotics research project in MIT CSAIL's Distributed Robotics Laboratory, and our goal was to train an AI agent to help pilots fly planes more safely. From this project, my passion for robotics research had blossomed, as I realized how much of an impact I could make in the world by pursuing a research career. I saw opportunities to improve a robot's abilities to act, perceive, and learn in complex environments, and this ultimately inspired me to pursue a career in helping create robots that can better help people. 
        </p>
        <h5>Hobbies and Other Interests</h5>
        <p>
        In my free time, I like taking walks, listening to rap music, working out, and playing and watching sports (huge Eagles	and Sixers fan, for the record).
        </p>
        <p>I really love math and physics, and will often watch a lot of youtube videos about these topics from time to time. I also enjoy philosophy, and I appreciate having deep discussions with people about philosophical topics, as learning about other people's world views fascinates me. </p>
