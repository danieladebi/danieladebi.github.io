        I was born in New Jersey and raised in Delaware for most of my life. However, I come from a Nigerian background, with my dad's side of the family being [Igbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people), and my mom's side of the family being [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people). 

        In my free time, I like taking walks, listening to rap music, working out, and playing and watching sports (huge Eagles	and Sixers fan, for the record).
