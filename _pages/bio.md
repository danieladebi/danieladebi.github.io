        <p>I was born in New Jersey and raised in Delaware for most of my life. However, I come from a Nigerian background, with my dad's side of the family being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people">Igbo</a>, and my mom's side of the family being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people">Yoruba</a>. </p>
        <p>
        In my free time, I like taking walks, listening to rap music, working out, and playing and watching sports (huge Eagles	and Sixers fan, for the record).
