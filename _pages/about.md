I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the <b>[University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/)</b>, and I am currently being co-advised by <b>[Prof. Joydeep Biswas](https://www.joydeepb.com/)</b> and <b>[Prof. Isil Dillig](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/)</b>. My research interests broadly lie at the intersection of <b>robotics</b>, <b>reinforcement learning</b>, <b>representation learning</b>, and <b>program synthesis</b> for the purposes of improving long-term planning and autonomy. Ultimately, I aim to improve a robotâ€™s ability to act, perceive, and learn in complex environments, and ensure that a machine's goals will always align with human goals.

Previously, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from the <b>[Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://web.mit.edu/)</b> studying Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence.
