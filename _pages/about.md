I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/). My research interests lie at the intersection of <b>robotics</b>, <b>reinforcement learning</b>, and <b>representation learning</b>. I aim to improve a robotâ€™s ability to act, perceive, and learn in complex environments, and ensure that a machine's goals will always align with human goals.

Previously, I received my S.B. and M.Eng. degrees from the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://web.mit.edu/), primarily studying Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence.

<h5>Other Facts About Me</h5>
I was born in New Jersey and raised in Delaware for most of my life. However, I come from a Nigerian background, with my dad's side of the family being [Igbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people), and my mom's side of the family being [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people). 

In my free time, I like taking walks, listening to rap music, working out, and playing and watching sports (huge Eagles	and Sixers fan, for the record).
