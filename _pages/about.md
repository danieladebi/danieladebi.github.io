I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/). My research interests lie at the intersection of <b>robotics</b>, <b>reinforcement learning</b>, and <b>representation learning</b>. I aim to improve a robotâ€™s ability to act, perceive, and learn in complex environments, and ensure that a machine's goals will always align with human goals.

Previously, I received my S.B. and M.Eng. degrees from the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://web.mit.edu/), primarily studying Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence.
