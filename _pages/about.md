I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the <b>[University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/)</b>, currently working under <b>[Prof. Kristen Grauman](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/)</b> in the UT Austin Computer Vision Group. My research interests broadly lie at the intersection of <b>robotics</b>, <b>embodied AI</b>, <b>representation learning</b>, and <b>program synthesis</b> for the purposes of improving long-term planning and autonomy. Ultimately, I aim to improve a robotâ€™s ability to act, perceive, and learn in complex environments, and ensure that a machine's goals will always align with human goals.

Previously, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from the <b>[Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://web.mit.edu/)</b> studying Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence.
